# Overview
Repository for my Python Logger class package, TimberWood.

Allows for easy and clean logging of program actions, warnings, errors, and even uncaught exceptions with the proper implementation. Also comes with simple assert package as well that allows for easy assert writing.

Originally started as an addition to a personal project that I wanted to extract into its own package with features that could be broadly applied to any project!

## Development Environment

- Python 3.12.3
- VSCode
